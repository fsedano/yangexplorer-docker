Just a dockerized yang-explorer, very useful to explore YANG models on a device.

To run it, use:

docker run -p 8088:8088  fsedano/yangexplorer

And then open http://127.0.0.1:8088 on your browser.

The application relies on Adobe Flash, so make sure your browser supports it and it's installed (Firefox recommended)
